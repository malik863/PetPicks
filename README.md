# PetPicks
PetPicks is a Flask-based web application that classifies images of pets as either dogs or cats using a pre-trained AI model from Teachable Machine. This project demonstrates basic machine learning integration with a web framework and includes features for image upload and classification.

Technologies
Frontend : javascript , html & css used for building user interface
Backend : Flask a web framework for building the application & teacheable machine which provides the pre-trained model for classification

Features
Image Upload: Allows users to upload images of pets.
Image Classification: Classifies the uploaded image as either a dog or a cat.
User Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for uploading images and viewing results.



##H2 Limitations

Limited animals type :The current model only classifies images as either dogs or cats. It does not support additional animals.
Images extensions :Not all images extensions is supported



##H2 future work
Support for More Animals
Extend the model to classify additional animal types such as birds, rabbits, or hamsters.

Enhanced User Interface
Improve the user interface with better styling, user feedback, and additional features such as drag-and-drop image upload.

Model Improvement
Upgrade the machine learning model with more training data to improve accuracy and include more diverse pet breeds.

Error Handling and Logging
Add detailed error handling and logging mechanisms to track issues and improve troubleshooting.
